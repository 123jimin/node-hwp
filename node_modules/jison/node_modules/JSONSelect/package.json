  "readme": "JSONSelect is *EXPERIMENTAL*, *ALPHA*, etc.\n\nJSONSelect defines a selector language similar to CSS intended for\nJSON documents.  For an introduction to the project see\n[jsonselect.org](http://jsonselect.org) or the [documentation](https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect/blob/master/JSONSelect.md).\n\n## Project Overview\n\nJSONSelect is an attempt to create a selector language similar to\nCSS for JSON objects.  A couple key goals of the project's include:\n\n  * **intuitive** - JSONSelect is meant to *feel like* CSS, meaning a developers with an understanding of CSS can probably guess most of the syntax.\n  * **expressive** - As JSONSelect evolves, it will include more of the most popular constructs from the CSS spec and popular implementations (like [sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com/)).  A successful result will be a good balance of simplicity and power.\n  * **language independence** - The project will avoid features which are unnecessarily tied to a particular implementation language.\n  * **incremental adoption** - JSONSelect features are broken in to conformance levels, to make it easier to build basic support and to allow incremental stabilization of the language.\n  * **efficient** - As many constructs of the language as possible will be able to be evaluated in a single document traversal.  This allows for efficient stream filtering.\n\nJSONSelect should make common operations easy, complex operations possible,\nbut haughtily ignore weird shit.\n\n## What's Here\n\nThis repository is the home to many things related to JSONSelect:\n\n  * [Documentation](https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect/blob/master/JSONSelect.md) which describes the language\n  * The [jsonselect.org](http://jsonselect.org) [site source](https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect/blob/master/site/)\n  * A [reference implementation](https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect/blob/master/src/jsonselect.js) in JavaScript\n\n## Related projects\n\nConformance tests are broken out into a [separate\nrepository](https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelectTests) and may be used\nby other implementations.",
